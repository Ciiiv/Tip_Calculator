# Tip_Calculator

This is just a goofy tip calculator app I thought about for a learning to code project. I started with watching youtube vids, googling, and some gpt on how to make the original .py to run locally. I then used gpt to learn how to convert to html & js to make a web app and host in git pages. Once that worked I used Median to make android and ios apps with webview to basically be a wrapper to load the url within. The calculator works and is a bit sarcastic. The url is https://ciiiv.github.io/Tip_Calculator/
